# Appointment Schedule

## A small fullstack web app which demonstrates a way to visualize and schedule medical appointments.

This project is a monorepo that contains a Node.js app built on the framework Nestjs and a React.js app created with Typescript

To run this app you must first install it's dependencies through Yarn and then start the app, also via Yarn. Once you already have Yarn installed on your computer you can run the command to start the app:

```sh
yarn bootstrap
```

To run the Server app you must set the following environment variables (or create a .env file on server's package folder with the variables):

```sh
DATABASE_TYPE
DATABASE_HOST
DATABASE_PORT
DATABASE_NAME
```
